      <p>
        Through the use of website's my mission is to get good resources to our communinty no matter what industry or background your in. On my Resources website you'll find theres a lot Tech related stuff and Production related resources. But what i believe to be the most improtant one, the Worship website <br><br>
        With this website my point is to get the word of our Abba across to people and for the people that are already with faith have the ability to grow in our Faith together. <br><br>
        So as said previously no matter your background my goal is to learn together as a community and just overall make it so even others are able to add to these resources so not just you guys but also i can learn a thing or two.
